- Design of a five-stage pipeline CPU, divided into five stages: fetch (IF), decode (ID), execute (EX), memory (MEM), and write back (WB).

- Supports 57 MIPS instructions. These include 52 basic instructions, including arithmetic operations, logical operations, shift instructions, branch instructions, data movement instructions, and memory access instructions, as well as 5 special instructions, including self-trap instructions and privileged instructions.

- Supports branch prediction

- implementation of multipliers and dividers

- SOC encapsulation with SRAM interface
